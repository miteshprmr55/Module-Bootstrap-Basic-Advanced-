    <!-- Question-6 

    • What is a Button Group, and what is the class for a basic Button Group?

    Answer :- 

    • Button Groups in Bootstrap is a class of name btn-group which is used to create a series of buttons in groups (without spaces) vertically or horizontally. 

    • Syntax :- This is the basic syntax of the button group class where each button has its own class of btn.

    • The .btn classes are designed to be used with the <button> element.
    However, you can also use these classes on <a> or <input> elements (though some browsers may apply a slightly different rendering).

    • Create a group of buttons using .btn in .btn-group class.
    • Example :- 

    <button type="button" class="btn btn-info">Register</button>

    <button type="button" class="btn btn-danger">Submit</button>

    <button type="button" class="btn btn-warning">Cancel</button> -->
