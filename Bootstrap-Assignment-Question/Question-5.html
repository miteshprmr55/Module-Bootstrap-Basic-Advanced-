    <!-- Question-5 

    • What is the difference between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5?

    Answer :- 

    • The form elements in Bootstrap 4 have defaulted to the browser-provided view. However, in Bootstrap 5, the form elements have a custom design that enables them to have a consistent look and feel in all browsers. The new form controls are based on completely semantic, standard form controls.

    • Unlike Bootstrap 4, Bootstrap 5 enables the developers to modify and create their own utilities.

    • Bootstrap 4 had limited color options. But Bootstrap 5 has included many new color options to its color palette, enabling you to choose from the various shades available. You can find some of the color shades below.

    • Bootstrap 4 didn't have an SVG icon library. You had to use other third-Party libraries like Font Awesome to use icons in your applications. But Bootstrap 5 has taken care of this issue by introducing its own SVG library with 1000+ icons.

    • Bootstrap 5 has moved to Hugo for its static site generation over Jekyll. Hugo is a fast static site generator implemented in Go and is quite popular.
