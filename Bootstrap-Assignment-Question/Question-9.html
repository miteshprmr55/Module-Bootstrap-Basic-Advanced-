    <!-- Question-9

    • How can one create an alert in Bootstrap?

    Answer :-

    • alert-dismissible class to the alert container. Then add class="close" and data-dismiss="alert" to a link or a
    button element

    • Be sure you ve loaded the alert plugin, or the compiled Bootstrap JavaScript.

    • If you re building our JavaScript from source, it requires util.js. The compiled version includes this.

    • Add a dismiss button and the .alert-dismissible class, which adds extra padding to the right of the alert and
    positions the .close button.

    • On the dismiss button, add the data-dismiss="alert" attribute, which triggers the JavaScript functionality. Be
    sure to use the <button> element with it for proper behavior across all devices.

    • To animate alerts when dismissing them, be sure to add the .fade and .show classes.

        • Example :-

        <div class="alert alert-warning alert-dismissible fade show" role="alert">
            your internet connection is very slow.
            <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close">
                <span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span>
            </button>
        </div> -->
