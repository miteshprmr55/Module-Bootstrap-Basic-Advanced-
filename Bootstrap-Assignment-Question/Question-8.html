    <!-- Question-8

    • In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?

    Answer :-

    • Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system that we can use to create a row or a column axis layout.

    • Quickly manage the layout, alignment, and sizing of grid columns, navigation, components, and more with a full
    suite of responsive flexbox utilities.

    • Bootstrap 4 now uses flexbox, instead of floats, to handle the layout. The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it
    easier to design flexible responsive layout structure without using float or positioning.

    • It makes our work easier to design and build responsive web pages without having to use tricky hacks and a lot of
    float and position properties in our CSS code.

    • Example :-

    <div class="d-flex">

        <div>Flex content 1</div>
        <div>Flex content 2</div>
        <div>Flex content 3</div>

    </div> -->
