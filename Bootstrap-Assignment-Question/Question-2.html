    <!-- Question-2

    • What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?

    Answer :- 

    • In Bootstrap the width of the container is 80% of 100% by default and the margins are auto.

    • Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.
